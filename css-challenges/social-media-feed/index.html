                            It's been such a long day at work. The customers are loud, 
                            the boss is nagging, and I have a splitting headache. I got
                            no sleep last night and I just want this day to be over so 
                            I can curl up and go to sleep
                        </p>

                            I'm so blessed to have such a good employee. I was being 
                            a total nag today, but he just kept trucking. Because of him, 
                            some very enraged customers left much happier than when they 
                            came in.

                            I went into a little shop today and was having an absolutely 
                            terrible day until this kid and his manager helped. My wife
                            was in the hospital and my kid was so worried. I was trying 
                            to take her mind off of things, so I was going to bring my 
                            kid icecream. When I got to the ice cream shop, they were 
                            fresh out of my kid's favorite kind, and I kind of went off. 
                            The manager was super understanding and even went to the 
                            grocery store nearby, got some of the icecream and loaded 
                            it up with toppings for my kid. They were awesome!!
