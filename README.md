# Welcome

This is the project containing my (Brett Pittman) work for the 2023 100 Days of Code. I decided I wanted to focus on learning and understanding a few things in particular during this time:
- CSS Grid
- Docker
- Svelte

Some days I needed a bit of a break, so I worked on the css challenges found in the css-challenges directory.
